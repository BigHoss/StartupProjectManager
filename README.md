When the computer is started, nothing will be run, no tray software, no desktop software. really nothing. and you get to choose what you will be working on.

### Feature List

 * for each configuration you can specify one ore more projects that should be loaded with each application
 * Cleanup feature (specify cleanup folders for each project/application)
* All Applications List
 * Display all applications found on the pc
* Properties
